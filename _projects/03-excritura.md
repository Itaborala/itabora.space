This Concrete Poem was ex-written in an attempt to represent a shift, or maybe a transformation of the written (both spoken and artistic) languages torwards a saturated information era. A way of analysing this poem is by dividing it in 3 layers: The visual structure; The words "escrita", "excrita", "escritura", "excritura" and their possible meanings; The way this poem was actually written (or maybe "discovered") using the Library of Babel and its mithology.

Visual Structure: The yellow-ish background might resemble an old paper, but *digital*. The font could also remind a typewritter. This could lead to an image of a person *typewritting on a screen*, in a sense of two incompatible technologies, but also in the sense of typewriting descending to keyboard writing, in the same way that itself was ascended by handwriting.
The words of this poem were very carefully written and positioned. The difference betwen the word length, the line length, the distance between word and the word repetition create this kind of *aliasing* effect that resulted in these backward and forward movements that are seen. There is a whispered suggestion here of being out of *phase*, and the aliasing interpretation can also bring us a notion of *speed*, of being slightly *slower*, or slightly *faster* than the "line velocity".
