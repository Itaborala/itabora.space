intro: |
  My results from the Reverse Engineering Challenge made by Manonna Yoder [@gatheringfolds](https://www.instagram.com/gatheringfolds/) of her Herringbone Weave Tesselation, normally folded in fabric.
  
  The Challenge consisted of analyzing two images (the back and the front) of the tesselation, reverse engineering its Crease Pattern, folding the model and sending a picture of the result. 
  I used a bullet journal for drawing the CP and a 15x15cm Tant Paper for the fold.
