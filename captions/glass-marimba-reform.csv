27.jpg, Redesigning the glass support system: 1cm gauge cotton string and one layer of white automobile foam headliner fabric on top. The keys are now separated and restricted from moving sideways by (non-touching) rubber-coated nails. Additionally, a nylon string, supported by the nails, passes on top of each key, reducing the jumping of the keys. The fastening tape will be changed by a white one, limiting transversal movements.

40.jpg, After a few months on the shelves and a some broken keys, I resurected the glass. I also started investigating the sound quality and the glass acoustics when coupled to the instrument. I realized that the keys note duration could be improved by shifting their absolute positions 5cm to the right, where the resting points of the keys could lie exactly at 1/6 of the key's length. For that, I had to retire the two rightmost keys.
41.jpg, I made some acoustic measurements of each key before and after the positioning changes. The bottom figure shows that not only the duration of the each note improved significantly, but also a noticeable improvement on the mid-high notes intensity was measured.
42.jpg, Each nail was finished with the following: the upper half was wrapped with water-blocking tape and then involved in a small rubber tube.

47.jpg, [Parenthesis] - In parallel to the reform, I took the opportunity to fabricate four mallets, properly designed for glass marimbas. The glass marimba mallet was designed by Marco Antônio Guimarães. They are made with vulcanized rubber blocks, sanded and grinded down to an "UFO" disk shape. This form enhances some inharmonic sound partials of the glass, and also reduces the probability of breaking the keys.
